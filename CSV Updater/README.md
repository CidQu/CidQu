# CSV Updater

You need to change four variable.

```python
keys_to_check = 'KEY'
value_to_update = 'TRANSLATED'
main_file = 'main.csv'
update_file = 'update.csv'
```

Then code will load update_file rows. If update_file has keys that match up with the main file it will automaticly update the variable(value_to_update) I mainly use it while translating Sunset Overdrive.
